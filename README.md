# Paper

Hello :wave:

This is a basic starter template for creating [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) sites.

## Getting started

These instructions are for those who intend to use this as a starter template for their own site. They assume that you know how to clone or fork a GitHub repo, check it out to your local computer and get a site running via the command line _(terminal)_.

1. Make a copy of this repo by cloning it locally, or forking it then cloning it locally, or by downloading the source
1. Navigate to this site in your terminal
1. run `gem install bundler jekyll`
1. run `bundle exec jekyll serve`
1. Open `http://localhost:4000/`
